Today we are implementing repetition using loops.
What is an array
How to solve some problems using loops and arrays

in a for loop the first term is the initialiser
the second term is the terminating condition test 
third is the incrementor

i++ increments by adding 1 to the value
i-- increments by taking 1 to the value
i+=1 another way to add one to the variable
i+=2 add two to the variable each time
i*=3 multiplies i by 3 each time

POINTERS: 
A pointer is the address of a block of memory with a variable in it.
If you declare a variable and pointer to that variable you can access it via the variable name or the pointer.
They are useful for arrays, functions and string handling
