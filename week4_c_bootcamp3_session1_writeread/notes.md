fprintf is the file equivalent of printf

if you use "a" the data inputted is added as well as the data already in the file

if you use "w" it replaces the data already in the file


atoi gets each line as a string and if its an integer converts it to an integer value instead

stdio.h and stdlib.h are header files
we can create our own header files
we need to supply the implementation of the function in a separate file
