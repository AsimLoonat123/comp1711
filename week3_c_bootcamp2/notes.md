IF statements

Contain a "catch all" at the end so that no value should be missed out

&& means AND
i.e. 

mark >= 0 && mark <= 100

means this checks that mark is >= 0 AND <=100

use switch case statements for option menus they are just a more readable and easier to type version of an if else statement especially if there are many options.
